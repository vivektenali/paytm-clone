Hi there,

I have Built my first **Tailwind Project.**

 
>Clone of Paytm Homepage

I have gained alot of knowledge while building this all thanks to [Tailwind]("https://tailwindcss.com/") documentation it has got one of the best explanations , that is its core concepts, how it works, and its usage.

Tailwind makes building web sites much quicker and easier by the classes it provides.

This project took me around 20hrs to build.
